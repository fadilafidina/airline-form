# Hi!

I started making my own sourdough bread (thanks Covid) and wanted to practice some beginner react in my spare time. And also get used to javascript.

So the first thing I'm making is a simple sourdough calculator app.

I did some research on some popular sourdough ratios out there: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arQHlimoQ7mk31QW3pKOMuSh2wwqXMCLChit9JuMpEM/edit?usp=sharing

And set up a lil trello board. I like breaking my work into smaller chunks: https://trello.com/b/RKfL2fQM/bread-calc

The "live" version is hosted on Netlify: https://sourdghcalc.netlify.app/
